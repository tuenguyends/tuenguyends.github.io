Hi!

I am Tue.

I am a MSc student in Quantitative Economics at Università Ca' Foscari (Italy) and Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain). Before this master's, I worked in the fintech industry for 4+ years in three roles - data specialist, research engineer, and data scientist. 

I expect to graduate in August 2023, and I plan to join the industry and work as an data scientist after graduation.

For more details about me, please see my [**CV**](/cv).  
For the projects I have done or am working on, please see my [**projects**](/projects).
