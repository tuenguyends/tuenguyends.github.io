Thus, create a folder for all of your book projects first, for example\nD:/projects/git/books/ Open a Git Bash terminal and navigate inside books/\ncd D:/projects/git/books/ Now create a new book, for example, my_book\njb create my_book This will create a minimal template for your book that you can start editing.\nRead more here\nAnatomy of a book There are three things that you need to build a book\nA configuration file: _config.yml A table of contents file: _toc.yml And your book\u0026rsquo;s content: .md and .ipynb files Here is a sample structure\nmy_book/ |__ _config.yml |__ _toc.yml |__ _static/ |__ 000_intro.md |__ 001_chapter_1.ipynb |__ 002_chapter_2.ipynb |__ logo.png |__ requirements.txt Config file All of the configuration for your book is in _config.yml. Example\ntitle: \u0026#34;Python tutorials\u0026#34; author: \u0026#34;Tue Nguyen\u0026#34; logo: logo.png execute: execute_notebooks: force Table of contents The table of contents defines the structure of your books (which files to include and their order). The configuration for TOC is in _toc.yml. Example\nformat: jb-book root: 000_intro chapters: - file: 001_chapter_1 - file: 002_chapter_2 - file: 003_chapter_3 Book content Your content is a collection of .md or .ipynb files. Read more about possible kinds of content here\nRules for all content files\nA file must have a single title (the first line start with #) Headers should increase linearly (for example, no jumping straight from # to ###) Static Put your images inside _static/img. If not, your images will not be rendered.\nBuild your book Inside the root directory of your book (i.e., my_book/, run the following command\njb build . Your HTML version of your book will be generated in _build/html. You can go inside it and preview some HTML files.\nPublish your book This section is a guide for deploying your book on Github only.\nMake your local repo a git repo and make your first commit git init Add a .gitignore file. Example content .ipynb_checkpoints */.ipynb_checkpoints/* _build Make your first commit git status git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; Sync this repo with your local repo and push your code git branch -M main git remote add origin path/to/your/github/account/my_book.git Auto build on push with Github actions by creating .gihub/workflows/gh_pages.yml with the following content name: deploy-book # Only run this when the master branch changes on: push: branches: - main # If your git repository has the Jupyter Book within some subfolder next to # unrelated files, you can make this run only if a file within that specific # folder has been modified. # # paths: # - some-subfolder/** # This job installs dependencies, builds the book, and pushes it to `gh-pages` jobs: deploy-book: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Install dependencies - name: Set up Python 3.8 uses: actions/setup-python@v2 with: python-version: 3.8 - name: Install dependencies run: | pip install -r requirements.txt # Build the book - name: Build the book run: | jupyter-book build . # Push the book\u0026#39;s HTML to github-pages - name: GitHub Pages action uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.6.1 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./_build/html Push your book on Github git push -u origin main Go to your repo and access Settings \u0026gt; Pages \u0026gt; Source and choose gh-pages for branch option and (root) for folder option. Structure of a book Here is a basic structure\n# _config.yml format: jb-book root: index chapters: - file: path/to/chapter1 - file: path/to/chapter2 You can organize your chapters into parts\n# _config.yml format: jb-book root: index parts: - caption: Name of Part 1 chapters: - file: path/to/part1/chapter1 - file: path/to/part1/chapter2 - caption: Name of Part 2 chapters: - file: path/to/part2/chapter1 - file: path/to/part2/chapter2 sections: - file: path/to/part2/chapter2/section1 My advice is to use chapters, not sections. Keep your book as flat as possible.\nRead more here\nOther notes Version control You should use separate branches for source and build. Best practices\nAdd _build to .gitignore on your main branch Push output of _build to gh-pages Caching To force Jupyter Book to re-build a particular page, you can delete the _build/html folder or run a full re-build\njb build --all .
